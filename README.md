## General Information
- The project is centered around the domain of risk analytics within the consumer finance industry. It aims to address the critical challenge of loan defaults, which significantly impacts a lending company's profitability. By employing data-driven methods, we seek to identify patterns and trends in loan applicant data that can predict the likelihood of default.
- The primary business problem is to minimize credit loss by accurately identifying loan applicants who are at a higher risk of default. This involves building a predictive model to assess creditworthiness and inform lending decisions, such as loan approval, interest rate determination, and loan amount.
- Loan Dataset provided by upGrad is used here ,also available in kaggle.
